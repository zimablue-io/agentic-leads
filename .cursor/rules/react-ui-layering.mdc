### Primitives (`packages/ui`)
- Pure presentational React components and design tokens only.
- **No** business logic, data fetching, or server actions.
- May use React hooks; remember to add `'use client'` when hooks are present.
- Export composable variants (e.g. `Button`, `Card`, `CarouselItem`).

### Feature Components (`apps/dashboard`)
- Screens, feature widgets, server actions, and data-aware hooks.
- Import primitives from `@ui/*` but **never** from other apps.
- May import server utilities from `@db/*` or `@supabase/ssr` helpers.

When creating a new component ask yourself: *Could another app reuse this?*  
If **yes**, place it in `packages/ui`. Otherwise keep it in the `apps/dashboard` tree.
